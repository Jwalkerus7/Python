# Python
Learning Python from Freecodecamp.
Starting my journey to become a Python developer.
In theses and coming lessons I will be learning the basics of Python as a 
beginner.
As I learn Python I will be able to learn Git to save my code on my local machine and Github to push my code to 
the Python.get respository.
