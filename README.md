# Python
Learning Python from Freecodecamp.
Starting my journey to become a Python developer.
In theses and coming lessons I will be learning the basics of Python as a 
beginner.
As I learn Python I will be able to learn Git to save my code on my local machine and Github to push my code to 
the Python.get respository.

I worked at this tutorial for about a month here and there before work, at my lunch break, and after work.
The way I worked through this was doing a couple of lessons and then going to HackerRank or Codewars and practicing what I learned
to help the learning process sink in even more.

Now on to Intermiediate Python course and building something.
